## Getting Started

1. Download and install Ganache
2. Create new project in Ganache
3. Download MetaMask wallet
4. Add new network of Ganache to MetaMask wallet
5. Fill in the network information just created in Ganache into the network section in truffle-config.js
6. Install package

npm i
```
7. Run smart contract
```bash
truffle compile

truffle migrate
```
8. Run the development server:

# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
